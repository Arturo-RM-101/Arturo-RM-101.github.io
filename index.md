### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was a my favorite lab because it was a good introduction to
    programming. It gave me a quick look into using C++ code. Teaching how to create
    and initialize variable with values.
    
 * Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was also my favorite lab because it had us create a guessing game
    on linux. It was fun having to guess the program's generated number. It also work more
    on using booleans and loops.
    
 * Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was my last favorite lab because it demonstrated how to create 2D
    vectors. It amazed me how it receives data from 2 separate vectors. It also
    helped improve using iterators and filters.
