### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was a my favorite lab because it was a good introduction to
    programming. It guided the basics of variables and initializing values to them
    as the starting topics of CPSC 120L. It was a good experience into
    starting to code a C++ program.
    
 * Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was also my favorite lab because it was about creating a short
    game on Linux. It was fun having to guess a randomly generated number by
    the program. It was also a great way to improve our understanding of how seperate
    .h and .cc files are used by one program.
    
 * Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was my last favorite lab because it demonstrated how 2D vectors
    works when the program runs. It was honestly surprising how to get a specific
    piece of information from 2 vectors. The way that you can create a single output
    message from 2 vectors is amazing.
